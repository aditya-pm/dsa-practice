# DSA Practice

Pattern-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository.

Contains solutions to problems from multiple sources such as **LeetCode**, **Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI)**, and others, along with basic data structure implementations used for learning and testing.

Problems are organized by **DSA patterns** (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.) rather than by platform.  
Solutions may be written in **multiple programming languages**.

This repository is maintained as a long-term learning journal for DSA fundamentals and interview preparation.
